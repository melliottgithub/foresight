dna/rna sequence:
-Gdo-Gdo-Ado-Ado-Tdo-Gro-Gro-Cro-Uro-Uro-Uro-Ur

elements are encoded: -Gdo or -Ums

1st character - : means "-" no modifications
2nd character - : represent the bases (example Gdo = G, Uro = U)
3rd character - : sugar backbone with r for RNA, d for DNA, or
another special character such as m for a modified RNA sugar. For -Gdo and -Ums, the
sugars are d and m
4th character - : phosphate linkage, which joins each combined base
and the sugar unit of the sequence together. For -Gdo and -Ums, the linkages are o and s
